3 - Coding_Challenge_Section_3.m is related to section 3 of the coding challenge. The code is written in Matlab. Calculations are only
carried for N=10 as the computer under use taking long to complete the calculations for N=20. Just do the below changes for N=20 in the given file,
Code line 5 : N=10 to N=20
Code line 17 : vpa(length(totPayment(totPayment>=45))) to vpa(length(totPayment(totPayment>=160)))
